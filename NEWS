ICU is used for tokenization and normalization of the following: mergekey,
sorting, relevance terms.

Debian package now enables ICU tokenization and normalization by default.

--- 1.0.2 2007/08/22

Exposed user setting values (i.e. non-pz: names) to the record systems in two
ways: Either as parameters to the normalization stylesheets (which would allow the
programmer to postprocess or use the values in any way) or after the normalization
step, in which case values are made part of the normalized record (and available for
sorting, termlists, display, or other interface-related use.

Implemented sorting by year.

Option -d dumps records to the current log file instead of stderr.

Fixes for compilation on cygwin.

Z39.50 client code uses pz:elements. pz:elements was recognized in

on MacOSX .

Loosen the CCL query parsing so that Pazpar2 only returns error if _all_
