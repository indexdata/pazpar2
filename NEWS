Fixed bug in pz2.js WRT DOMElement attributes on IE.

Fixed bug 2100: Database wildcards not working

Added support for retrieval of records in binary.

Fixed bug 1794: Pazpar2 does not return valid XML.

Deal with ICU not returning sortkey (resulted in SEGV before).

--- 1.0.4 2007/09/28

JavaScript library pzw2.js throws error if WS response (from Pazpar2 or
other) is malformed (non-wellformed XML or missing Pazpar2 OK status).

Improved diagnostics when Pazpar2 HTTP decoding fails.

Pazpar2 requests may be POSTed as using Content-Type
application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

Pazpar2 honors LF in HTTP headers.

Handle targets that handle negative hit counts (should not happen, but it
does).

--- 1.0.3 2007/09/19

ICU is used for tokenization and normalization of the following: mergekey,
sorting, relevance terms.

Debian package now enables ICU tokenization and normalization by default.

--- 1.0.2 2007/08/22

Exposed user setting values (i.e. non-pz: names) to the record systems in two
ways: Either as parameters to the normalization stylesheets (which would allow the
programmer to postprocess or use the values in any way) or after the normalization
step, in which case values are made part of the normalized record (and available for
sorting, termlists, display, or other interface-related use.

Implemented sorting by year.

Option -d dumps records to the current log file instead of stderr.

Fixes for compilation on cygwin.

Z39.50 client code uses pz:elements. pz:elements was recognized in
earlier Pazpar2 versions but it was not used for anything.

icu_chain_test is using fgets instead of getline - fixes compilation
on MacOSX .

Loosen the CCL query parsing so that Pazpar2 only returns error if _all_
query conversions fail (rather than _any_). This means targets that do
not support some fields are ignored in a search.

--- 1.0.1 2007/07/03

Improved handling of socket timeout for Z39.50 connections. 

Misc documentation updates and spell fixes.

Debian package pazpar2 creates log rotate entry.

JavaScript library.
