   <title>Introduction</title>
   <para>
     Pazpar2 is a stand-alone metasearch client with a webservice API, designed
     to be used either from a browser-based client (JavaScript, Flash, Java,
     etc.), from from server-side code, or any combination of the two.
     Pazpar2 is a highly optimized client designed to
     search many resources in parallel. It implements record merging,
     relevance-ranking and sorting by arbitrary data content, and facet
     analysis for browsing purposes. It is designed to be data model
     independent, and is capable of working with MARC, DublinCore, or any
     other XML-structured response format -- XSLT is used to normalize and extract
     data from retrieval records for display and analysis. It can be used
     against any server which supports the Z39.50 protocol. Proprietary
     backend modules can be used to support a large number of other protocols
     (please contact Index Data for further information about this).
   </para>
   <para>
      Additional functionality such as
     user management, attractive displays are expected to be implemented by
     applications that use pazpar2. Pazpar2 is user interface independent.
     Its functionality is exposed through a simple REST-style webservice API,
     designed to be simple to use from an Ajax-enbled browser, Flash
     animation, Java applet, etc., or from a higher-level server-side language
     like PHP or Java. Because session information can be shared between
     browser-based logic and your server-side scripting, there is tremendous
     flexibility in how you implement your business logic on top of pazpar2.
   </para>
   <para>
     Once you launch a search in pazpar2, the operation continues behind the
     scenes. Pazpar2 connects to servers, carries out searches, and
     retrieves, deduplicates, and stores results internally. Your application
     code may periodically inquire about the status of an ongoing operation,
     and ask to see records or other result set facets. Result become
     available immediately, and it is easy to build end-user interfaces which
     feel extremely responsive, even when searching more than 100 servers
     concurrently.
   </para>
   <para>
     Pazpar2 is designed to be highly configurable. Incoming records are
     normalized to XML/UTF-8, and then further normalized using XSLT to a
     simple internal representation that is suitable for analysis. By
     providing XSLT stylesheets for different kinds of result records, you
     can tune pazpar2 to work against different kinds of information
     retrieval servers. Finally, metadata is extracted, in a configurable
     way, from this internal record, to support display, merging, ranking,
     result set facets, and sorting. Pazpar2 is not bound to a specific model
     of metadata, such as DublinCore or MARC -- by providing the right
     configuration, it can work with a number of different kinds of data in
     support of many different applications.
   </para>
   <para>
     Pazpar2 is designed to be efficient and scalable. You can set it up to
     search several hundred targets in parallel, or you can use it to support
     hundreds of concurrent users. It is implemented with the same attention
     to performance and economy that we use in our indexing engines, so that
     you can focus on building your application, without worrying about the
     details of metasearch logic. You can devote all of your attention to
     usability and let pazpar2 do what it does best -- metasearch.
    </para>
    <para>
      If you wish to connect to commercial or other databases which do not
      support open standards, please contact Index Data. We have a licensing
      agreement with a third party vendor which will enable pazpar2 to access
      thousands of online databases, in addition the vast number of catalogs
      and online services that support the Z39.50 protocol.
    </para>
    <para>
      Pazpar2 is our attempt to re-think the traditional paradigms for
      implementing and deploying metasearch logic, with an uncompromising
      approach to performance, and attempting to make maximum use of the
      capabilities of modern browsers. The demo user interface that
      accompanies the distribution is but one example. If you think of new
      ways of using pazpar2, we hope you'll share them with us, and if we
      can provide assistance with regards to training, design, programming,
      integration with different backends, hosting, or support, please don't
      hesitate to contact us. If you'd like to see functionality in pazpar2
      that is not there today, please don't hesitate to contact us. It may
      already be in our development pipeline, or there might be a
      possibility for you to help out by sponsoring development time or
      code. Either way, get in touch and we will give you straight answers.

  <chapter id="using">
    <title>Using pazpar2</title>
    <para>
      This chapter provides a general introduction to the use and deployment of pazpar2.
    </para>

    <section id="architecture">
      <title>Pazpar2 and your systems architecture</title>
      <para>
	Pazpar2 is designed to provide asynchronous, behind-the-scenes
	metasearching functionality to your application, exposing this
	functionality using a simple webservice API that can be accessed
	from any number of development environments. In particular, it is
	possible to combine pazpar2 either with your server-side dynamic
	website scripting, with scripting or code running in the browser, or
	with any combination of the two. Pazpar2 is an excellent tool for
	building advanced, Ajax-based user interfaces for metasearch
	functionality, but it isn't a requirement -- you can choose to use
	pazpar2 entirely as a backend to your regular server-side scripting.
	When you do use pazpar2 in conjunction
	with browser scripting (JavaScript/Ajax, Flash, applets, etc.), there are
	special considerations.
      </para>

      <para>
        Pazpar2 implements a simple but efficient HTTP server, and it is
	designed to interact directly with scripting running in the browser
	for the best possible performance, and to limit overhead when
	several browser clients generate numerous webservice requests.
	However, it is still desirable to use a conventional webserver,
	such as Apache, to serve up graphics, HTML documents, and
	server-side scripting. Because the security sandbox environment of
	most browser-side programming environments only allows communication
	with the server from which the enclosing HTML page or object
	originated, pazpar2 is designed so that it can act as a transparent
	proxy in front of an existing webserver (see <xref
	linkend="pazpar2_conf"/> for details). In this mode, all regular
	HTTP requests are transparently passed through to your webserver,
	while pazpar2 only intercepts search-related webservice requests.
      </para>

      <para>
        If you want to expose your combined service on port 80, you can
	either run your regular webserver on a different port, a different
	server, or a different IP address associated with the same server.
      </para>

      <para>
        Sometimes, it may be necessary to implement functionality on your
	regular webserver that makes use of search results, for example to
	implement data import functionality, emailing results, history
	lists, personal citation lists, interlibrary loan functionality
	,etc. Fortunately, it is simple to exchange information between
	pazpar2, your browser scripting, and backend server-side scripting.
	You can send a session ID and possibly a record ID from your browser
	code to your server code, and from there use pazpar2s webservice API
	to access result sets or individual records. You could even 'hide'
	all of pazpar2s functionality between your own API implemented on
	the server-side, and access that from the browser or elsewhere. The
	possibilities are just about endless.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="data_model">
      <title>Your data model</title>
      <para>
        Pazpar2 does not have a preconceived model of what makes up a data
	model. There are no assumption that records have specific fields or
	that they are organized in any particular way. The only assumption
	is that data comes packaged in a form that the software can work
	with (presently, that means XML or MARC), and that you can provide
	the necessary information to massage it into pazpar2's internal
	record abstraction.
      </para>

      <para>
        Handling retrieval records in pazpar2 is a two-step process. First,
	you decide which data elements of the source record you are
	interested in, and you specify any desired massaging or combining of
	elements using an XSLT stylesheet (MARC records are automatically
	normalized to MARCXML before this step). If desired, you can run
	multiple XSLT stylesheets in series to accomplish this, but the
	output of the last one should be a representation of the record in a
	schema that pazpar2 understands.
      </para>

      <para>
        The intermediate, internal representation of the record looks like
	this:
	<screen><![CDATA[
<record   xmlns="http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/1.0"
	  mergekey="title The Shining author King, Stephen">

    <metadata type="title">The Shining</metadata>

    <metadata type="author">King, Stephen</metadata>

    <metadata type="kind">ebook</metadata>

    <!-- ... and so on -->
</record>
]]></screen>

        As you can see, there isn't much to it. There are really only a few
	important elements to this file.
      </para>

      <para>
        Elements should belong to the namespace
	http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/1.0. If the root node contains the
	attribute 'mergekey', then every record that generates the same
	merge key (normalized for case differences, white space, and
	truncation) will be joined into a cluster. In other words, you
	decide how records are merged. If you don't include a merge key,
	records are never merged. The 'metadata' elements provide the meat
	of the elements -- the content. the 'type' attribute is used to
	match each element against processing rules that determine what
	happens to the data element next.
      </para>

      <para>
        The next processing step is the extraction of metadata from the
	intermediate representation of the record. This is governed by the
	'metadata' elements in the 'service' section of the configuration
	file. See <xref linkend="config-server"/> for details. The metadata
	in the retrieval record ultimately drives merging, sorting, ranking,
	the extraction of browse facets, and display, all configurable.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="client">
      <title>Client development</title>
      <para>
        You can use pazpar2 from any environment that allows you to use
	webservices. The initial goal of the software was to support
	Ajax-based applications, but there literally are no limits to what
	you can do. You can use pazpar2 from Javascript, Flash, Java, etc.,
	on the browser side, and from any development environment on the
	server side, and you can pass session tokens and record IDs freely
	around between these environments to build sophisticated applications.
	Use your imagination.
      </para>

      <para>
        The webservice API of pazpar2 is described in detail in <xref
	linkend="pazpar2_protocol"/>.
      </para>

      <para>
        In brief, you use the 'init' command to create a session, a
	temporary workspace which carries information about the current
	search. You start a new search using the 'search' command. Once the
	search has been started, you can follow its progress using the
	'stat', 'bytarget', 'termlist', or 'show' commands. Detailed records
	can be fetched using the 'record' command.
