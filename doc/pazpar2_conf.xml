 <refsect1><title>DESCRIPTION</title>
   <para>
     The pazpar2 configuration file, together with any referenced XSLT files,
     govern pazpar2's behavior as a client, and control the normalization and
     extraction of data elements from incoming result records, for the
     purposes of merging, sorting, facet analysis, and display.
    </para>

    <para>
      The file is specified using the option -f on the pazpar2 command line.
      There is not presently a way to reload the configuration file without
      restarting pazpar2, although this will most likely be added some time
      in the future.
    </para>
 </refsect1>

 <refsect1><title>FORMAT</title>
   <para>
     The configuration file is XML-structured. It must be valid XML. All
     elements specific to pazpar2 should belong to the namespace
     "http://www.indexdata.com/pazpar2/1.0" (this is assumed in the
     following examples). The root element is named 'pazpar2'. Under the
     root element are a number of elements which group categories of
     information. The categories are described below.
    </para>

    <refsect2 id="config-server"><title>server</title>
      <para>
        This section governs overall behavior of the client. The data
	elements are described below.
      </para>
      <variablelist> <!-- level 1 -->
        <varlistentry>
	  <term>listen</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Configures the webservice -- this controls how you can connect
	      to pazpar2 from your browser or server-side code. The
	      attributes 'host' and 'port' control the binding of the
	      server. The 'host' attribute can be used to bind the server to
	      a secondary IP address of your system, enabling you to run
	      pazpar2 on port 80 alongside a conventional web server. You
	      can override this setting on the command lineusing the option -h.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>proxy</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If this item is given, pazpar2 will forward all incoming HTTP
	      requests that do not contain the filename 'search.pz2' to the
	      host and port specified using the 'host' and 'port'
	      attributes. The 'myurl' attribute is required, and should provide
	      the base URL of the server. Generally, the HTTP URL for the host
	      specified in the 'listen' parameter. This functionality is
	      crucial if you wish to use
	      pazpar2 in conjunction with browser-based code (JS, Flash,
	      applets, etc.) which operates in a security sandbox. Such code
	      can only connect to the same server from which the enclosing
	      HTML page originated. Pazpar2s proxy functionality enables you
	      to host all of the main pages (plus images, CSS, etc) of your
	      application on a conventional webserver, while efficiently
	      processing webservice requests for metasearch status, results,
	      etc.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>zproxy</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      If this item is given, pazpar2 will send all Z39.50
	      packages through this Z39.50 proxy server.
              At least one of the 'host' and 'post' attributes is required.
              The 'host' attribute may contain both host name and port
	      number, seperated by a colon ':', or only the host name.
              An empty 'host' attribute sets the Z39.50 host address
	      to 'localhost'.  
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>

	<varlistentry>
	  <term>service</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This nested element controls the behavior of pazpar2 with
	      respect to your data model. In pazpar2, incoming records are
	      normalized, using XSLT, into an internal representation.
	      The 'service' section controls the further processing and
	      extraction of data from the internal representation, primarily
	      through the 'metdata' sub-element.
	    </para>

	    <variablelist> <!-- Level 2 -->
	      <varlistentry><term>metadata</term>
	        <listitem>
		  <para>
		    One of these elements is required for every data element in
		    the internal representation of the record (see
		    <xref linkend="data_model"/>. It governs
		    subsequent processing as pertains to sorting, relevance
		    ranking, merging, and display of data elements. It supports
		    the following attributes:
		  </para>

		  <variablelist> <!-- level 3 -->
		    <varlistentry><term>name</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  This is the name of the data element. It is matched
			  against the 'type' attribute of the 'metadata' element
			  in the normalized record. A warning is produced if
			  metdata elements with an unknown name are found in the
			  normalized record. This name is also used to represent
			  data elements in the records returned by the
			  webservice API, and to name sort lists and browse
			  facets.
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>type</term>
		     <listitem>
			<para>
			  The type of data element. This value governs any
			  normalization or special processing that might take
			  place on an element. Possible values are 'generic'
			  (basic string), 'year' (a range is computed if
			  multiple years are found in the record). Note: This
			  list is likely to increase in the future.
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>brief</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  If this is set to 'yes', then the data element is
			  includes in brief records in the webservice API. Note
			  that this only makes sense for metadata elements that
			  are merged (see below). The default value is 'no'.
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>sortkey</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  Specifies that this data element is to be used for
			  sorting. The possible values are 'numeric' (numeric
			  value), 'skiparticle' (string; skip common, leading
			  articles), and 'no' (no sorting). The default value is
			  'no'.
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>rank</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  Specifies that this element is to be used to help rank
			  records against the user's query (when ranking is
			  requested). The value is an integer, used as a
			  multiplier against the basic TF*IDF score. A value of
			  1 is the base, higher values give additional weight to
			  elements of this type. The default is '0', which
			  excludes this element from the rank calculation.
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>termlist</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  Specifies that this element is to be used as a
			  termlist, or browse facet. Values are tabulated from
			  incoming records, and a highscore of values (with
			  their associated frequency) is made available to the
			  client through the webservice API. The possible values
			  are 'yes' and 'no' (default).
			</para>
		      </listitem>
		    </varlistentry>

		    <varlistentry><term>merge</term>
		      <listitem>
			<para>
			  This governs whether, and how elements are extracted
			  from individual records and merged into cluster
			  records. The possible values are: 'unique' (include
			  all unique elements), 'longest' (include only the
			  longest element (strlen), 'range' (calculate a range
			  of values across al matching records), 'all' (include
			  all elements), or 'no' (don't merge; this is the
			  default);

 <refsect1><title>TARGET SETTINGS</title>
   <para>
     Pazpar2 features a cunning scheme by which you can associate various
     kinds of attributes, or settings with search targets. This is done
     through XML files; each file can associate one or more settings
     with one or more targets. The file format is generic in nature,
     designed to support a wide range of application requirements. The
     settings can be purely technical things, like, how to perform a title
     search against a given target, or it can associate arbitrary name=value
     pairs with groups of targets -- for instance, if you would like to
     place all commercial full-text bases in one group for selection
     purposes, or you would like to control what targets are accessible to a
     given user.
   </para>

   <para>
     During startup, pazpar2 will recursively read a specified directory
     (can be identified in the pazpar2.cfg file or on the command line), and
     process any settings files found therein.
   </para>

   <refsect2><title>SETTINGS FILE FORMAT</title>
     <para>
       Each file contains a root element named &lt;settings&gt;. It may
       contain one or more &lt;set&gt; elements. The settings and set
       elements may contain the following attributes. Attributes in set
       overrides those in the setting root element. Each set node must
       specify (directly, or inherited from the parent node) at least a
       target, name, and value.
     </para>

     <variablelist> 
       <varlistentry>
	 <term>target</term>
	 <listitem>
	   <para>
	     This specifies the search target to which this setting should be
	     applied. Targets are identified by their Z39.50 URL, generally
	     including the host, port, and database name, (e.g.
	     bagel.indexdata.com:210/marc). Two wildcard forms are accepted:
	     * (asterisk) matches all known targets;
	     bagel.indexdata.com:210/* matches all known databases on the given
	     host.
	   </para>
	   <para>
	     A precedence system determines what happens if there are
	     overlapping values for the same setting name for the same
	     target. A setting for a specific target name overrides a
	     setting whch specifies target using a wildcard. This makes it
	     easy to set defaults for all targets, and then override them
	     for specific targets or hosts. If there are
	     multiple overlapping settings with the same name and target
	     value, the 'precedence' attribute determines what happens.
	    </para>
	 </listitem>
       </varlistentry>
       <varlistentry>
         <term>user</term>
	 <listitem>
	   <para>
	     This specifies the user ID to which this setting applies. A
	     given setting may have values for any number of users, or it
	     may have a 'default' value which is applied when no user is
	     specified, or when no user-specific value is available.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>name</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The name of the setting. This can be anything you like.
	      However, pazpar2 reserves a number of setting names for
	      specific purposes, all starting with 'pz:', and it is a good
	      idea to avoid that prefix if you make up your own setting
	      names. See below for a list of reserved variables.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>value</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The value of the setting. Generally, this can be anything you
	      want -- however, some of the reserved settings may expect
	      specific kinds of values.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>precedence</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This should be an integer. If not provided, the default value
	      is 0. If two (or more) settings have the same content for
	      target and name, the precedence value determines the outcome.
	      If both settings have the same precedence value, they are both
	      applied to the target(s). If one has a higher value, then the
	      value of that setting is applied, and the other one is ignored.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>
        By setting defaults for user, target, name, or value in the root
	settings node, you can use the settings files in many different
	ways. For instance, you can use a single file to set defaults for
	many different settings, like search fields, retrieval syntaxes,
	etc. You can have one file per server, which groups settings for
	that server or target. You could also have one file which associates
	a number of targets with a given setting, for instance, to associate
	many databases with a given category or class that makes sense
	within your application.
      </para>

    </refsect2>

    <refsect2><title>RESERVED SETTING NAMES</title>
      <para>
        The following setting names are reserved by pazpar2 to control the
	behavior of the client function.
      </para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
	  <term>pz:cclmap:xxx</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      This establishes a CCL field definition or other setting, for
	      the purpose of mapping end-user queries. XXX is the field or
	      setting name, and the value of the setting provides parameters
	      (e.g. parameters to send to the server, etc.). Please consult
	      the YAZ manual for a full overview of the many capabilities of
	      the powerful and flexible CCL parser.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      Note that it is easy to etablish a set of default parameters,
	      and then override them individually for a given target.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>pz:syntax</term>
	  <listitem>

	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>pz:piggyback</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Piggybacking enables the server to retrieve records from the
	      server as part of the search response in Z39.50. Almost all
	      servers support this (or fail it gracefully), but a few
	      servers will produce undesirable results.
	      Set to '1' to enable piggybacking, '0' to disable it. Default
	      is 1 (piggybacking enabled).
	    </para>

	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>pz:nativesyntax</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The representation of the retrieval records. Currently
	      recognized values are iso2709 and xml.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</varlistentry>
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>pz:encoding</term>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      The native encoding of retrieval records. Can be anything
