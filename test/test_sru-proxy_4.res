<md-title>Any old iron?</md-title>
<md-description>The article examines research on water pollution control. The use of ferrates, which are iron-oxygen compounds which include non-transition metals, to remove pollutants from water is discussed. The high reactivity of ferrates make them both oxidizing agents and coagulants of other chemicals in water. The company Ferrate Treatment Technologies, which creates ferrates at the site of pollution control projects since they are highly unstable, is discussed</md-description><location id="kb.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="sru-proxy">

<md-title>EPA Outlines Aggressive Plan To Restore Chesapeake Bay</md-title>
<md-author>Hunter, Pam</md-author>
<md-description>The article deals with the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) launched by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on December 29, 2010. TDML implements a legal framework to make sure that six states and the District of Columbia comply with the requirement set to restore the Chesapeake Bay between Maryland and Virginia by 2025. Furthermore, TDML requires a 25 percent nitrogen reduction, 24 percent phosphorus reduction and 20 percent sediment reduction. EPA intends to oversee every one of the jurisdictions&apos; programs</md-description><location id="kb.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="sru-proxy">

<md-title>Graywater Recycling Turns Runoff Into Green Solution</md-title>
<md-author>Penny, Janelle</md-author>
<md-description>The article discusses how the emerging trend of graywater recycling could help cut costs and conserve water. According to Jason Rector, owner of AquaPro, reusing graywater could significantly reduce water consumption for buildings since estimates indicate that 40% to 60% of water in buildings is flushwed down the toilet. Simple graywater systems involve the collection of water from one bathroom sink, filtering it and redirecting it into the tank of another toilet</md-description><location id="kb.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="sru-proxy">

<md-title>A negotiated solution for the Jordan Basin</md-title>
<md-author>Chóliz, J. S</md-author>
<md-description>The use of water in the Jordan Basin has been a key factor in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and among Israel and its neighbours. In this paper, we explore possible ways of sharing water through a negotiation game with two players-Arabs and Israelis. We estimate a set of optimum Pareto allocations, as well as identifying a range of negotiated solutions. Our results suggest that viable solutions would improve incomes by some 20% compared to the current status quo. These solutions are close to the long-standing proposal contained in the Johnston Plan. Meanwhile, theoretical fairness criteria, which are more favourable to the Arabs than the Johnston Plan, maybe are not actually better in technical terms and could in any case only be achieved if the Arabs&apos; negotiating position were much stronger than the Israelis&apos;</md-description><location id="kb.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="sru-proxy">

<md-title>Smoke in the (Tariff) Water</md-title>
<md-author>Nicita, Alessandro</md-author>
<md-description>As the economic crisis deepened and widened, fears of a return to the protectionist spiral of the 1930s become more common. However, an important difference between the 1930s and today is the existence of the World Trade Organization and the legal limits it imposes on the protectionist responses members can pursue. The first objective of this paper is to assess the extent to which applied tariffs can be legally raised without violating bound tariff obligations and compare it with what is economically feasible. The second objective is the examination of whether individual countries have taken advantage of these legal tariff hikes as protectionist responses during economic crises, after the creation of the WTO. Results suggest that the policy space left when looking at what is economically possible is indeed quite large. However, in the recent past little of the available policy space has been used by countries suffering from an economic crisis</md-description><location id="kb.dadsthirdnode.cvt.dk/sru-proxy" name="sru-proxy">
